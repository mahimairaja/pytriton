# Quick Start

The prerequisite for this page is to install PyTriton, which can be found
in the [installation](installation.md)
page.

The Quick Start presents how to run a Python model in the Triton Inference Server without needing to change the current working
environment. In this example, we are using a simple `Linear` PyTorch model.

The integration of the model requires providing the following elements:

- The model - a framework or Python model or function that handles inference requests
- Inference Callable - function or class with `__call__` method, that handles the input data coming from Triton and returns the result
- Python function connection with Triton Inference Server - a binding for communication between Triton and the Inference Callable

The requirement for the example is to have PyTorch installed in your environment. You can do this by running:

<!--pytest.mark.skip-->

```shell
pip install torch
```

In the next step, define the `Linear` model:

```python
import torch

model = torch.nn.Linear(2, 3).to("cuda").eval()
```

In the second step, create an inference callable as a function. The function obtains the HTTP/gRPC request data as an argument, which should be in the form of a NumPy array. The expected return object should also be a NumPy array. You can define an inference callable as a function that uses the `@batch` decorator from PyTriton. This decorator converts the input request into a more suitable format that can be directly passed to the model. You can read more about [decorators here](decorators.md).

Example implementation:

<!--pytest-codeblocks:cont-->

```python
import numpy as np
import torch

from pytriton.decorators import batch


@batch
def infer_fn(**inputs: np.ndarray):
    (input1_batch,) = inputs.values()
    input1_batch_tensor = torch.from_numpy(input1_batch).to("cuda")
    output1_batch_tensor = model(input1_batch_tensor) # Calling the Python model inference
    output1_batch = output1_batch_tensor.cpu().detach().numpy()
    return [output1_batch]
```

In the next step, you can create the binding between the inference callable and Triton Inference Server using the `bind` method from PyTriton. This method takes the model name, the inference callable, the inputs and outputs tensors, and an optional model configuration object.

<!--pytest-codeblocks:cont-->

```python
from pytriton.model_config import ModelConfig, Tensor
from pytriton.triton import Triton

# Connecting inference callable with Triton Inference Server
with Triton() as triton:
    triton.bind(
        model_name="Linear",
        infer_func=infer_fn,
        inputs=[
            Tensor(dtype=np.float32, shape=(-1,)),
        ],
        outputs=[
            Tensor(dtype=np.float32, shape=(-1,)),
        ],
        config=ModelConfig(max_batch_size=128)
    )
    ...
```

Finally, serve the model with the Triton Inference Server:

<!--pytest.mark.skip-->

```python
from pytriton.triton import Triton

with Triton() as triton:
    ...  # Load models here
    triton.serve()
```

The `bind` method creates a connection between the Triton Inference Server and the `infer_fn`, which handles
the inference queries. The `inputs` and `outputs` describe the model inputs and outputs that are exposed in
Triton. The config field allows more parameters for model deployment.

The `serve` method is blocking, and at this point, the application waits for incoming HTTP/gRPC requests. From that
moment, the model is available under the name `Linear` in the Triton server. The inference queries can be sent to
`localhost:8000/v2/models/Linear/infer`, which are passed to the `infer_fn` function.

If you would like to use Triton in the background mode, use `run`. More about that can be found
in the [Deploying Models](initialization.md) page.

Once the `serve` or `run` method is called on the `Triton` object, the server status can be obtained using:

<!--pytest.mark.skip-->

```shell
curl -v localhost:8000/v2/health/live
```

The model is loaded right after the server starts, and its status can be queried using:

<!--pytest.mark.skip-->

```shell
curl -v localhost:8000/v2/models/Linear/ready
```

Finally, you can send an inference query to the model:
<!--pytest.mark.skip-->

```shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"  \
  -d @input.json \
  localhost:8000/v2/models/Linear/infer
```

The `input.json` with sample query:

```json
{
  "id": "0",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "INPUT_1",
      "shape": [1, 2],
      "datatype": "FP32",
      "parameters": {},
      "data": [[-0.04281254857778549, 0.6738349795341492]]
    }
  ]
}
```

Read more about the HTTP/gRPC interface in the Triton Inference Server
[documentation](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/customization_guide/inference_protocols.md#httprest-and-grpc-protocols).

You can also validate the deployed model using a simple client that can perform inference requests:

<!--pytest.mark.skip-->

```python
import torch
from pytriton.client import ModelClient

input1_data = torch.randn(128, 2).cpu().detach().numpy()

with ModelClient("localhost:8000", "Linear") as client:
    result_dict = client.infer_batch(input1_data)

print(result_dict)
```

The full example code can be found in [examples/linear_random_pytorch](../examples/linear_random_pytorch).

More information about running the server and models can be found in [Deploying Models](initialization.md) page.
